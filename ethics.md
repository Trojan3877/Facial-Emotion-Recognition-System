# Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI

## Bias and Fairness
Facial emotion recognition systems are sensitive to demographic bias related to age, ethnicity, and facial structure. If the training data is not representative, predictions may be less accurate for underrepresented groups.

## Privacy
Facial images are biometric data. This system is designed for research and educational purposes only and does not store or transmit personal identity information.

## Intended Use
This project is intended for:
- Academic research
- UX analysis
- Human–computer interaction studies

## Non-Intended Use
This system should not be used for:
- Surveillance
- Law enforcement decision-making
- Medical diagnosis without professional oversight

## Mitigation Strategies
- Dataset diversity analysis
- Confidence scoring instead of hard labels
- Clear disclosure of system limitations

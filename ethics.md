# Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI

## Bias and Fairness
Facial emotion recognition systems are susceptible to demographic bias related to age, ethnicity, facial structure, and cultural expression of emotions. If training data is not sufficiently diverse, prediction accuracy may vary across populations.

## Privacy and Data Protection
Facial images are considered biometric data. This project does not store, identify, or track individuals and is intended solely for educational and research purposes. No personally identifiable information (PII) is retained.

## Intended Use
This system is intended for:
- Academic research
- Human–computer interaction experiments
- UX analysis and educational demonstrations

## Non-Intended Use
This system should not be used for:
- Surveillance or monitoring
- Law enforcement or legal decision-making
- Medical or psychological diagnosis

## Mitigation Strategies
- Use of confidence scores instead of absolute predictions
- Clear disclosure of system limitations
- Ongoing evaluation of dataset diversity and bias

## Overview

This project implements a production-style **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify human facial expressions into key emotion categories.

The pipeline includes:
✅ Data ingestion & preprocessing  
✅ Model training & evaluation  
✅ Real-time inference pipeline  
✅ Visualizations and performance reporting

---

## Business Impact

**Facial Emotion Recognition** is a valuable capability for:
- Customer experience optimization in retail and online services  
- Healthcare and mental health monitoring  
- Driver safety systems (automotive AI)  
- Human-computer interaction (HCI) applications  

The system is built for easy extensibility and potential cloud deployment.
